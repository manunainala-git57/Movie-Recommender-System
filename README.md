# 🎮 Movie Recommender System

A **Movie Recommender System** built using **Flask** for the backend and **React** for the frontend. It uses machine learning algorithms to suggest movies based on user preferences.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Provides personalized movie recommendations
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on `movies_data.csv`
- Built with a **Flask** backend and a **React** frontend
- Uses **pandas**, **numpy**, and **scikit-learn** for data processing and ML algorithms

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Backend: Flask**
- Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to handle API requests and serve recommendations.

### **Frontend: React**
- React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### **Libraries Used**
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: Contains machine learning algorithms used for building the recommendation model.

---

## 💂️ Dataset
The dataset used for training the recommendation model is **movies_data.csv**, which contains movie-related information required for making predictions.
